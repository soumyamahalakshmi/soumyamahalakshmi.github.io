        <p>
                I am passionate about technology and am currently working as a Technology Analyst at Goldman Sachs. 
                Having emerged as a Gold medalist in Computer Science during my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering, 
                from R V College for Engineering, Bangalore, I love the fact that I get to work in happening areas 
                such as Big data, on an everyday basis. Creativity is my sanctuary and I enjoy poetry slams and writing, 
                having won accolades for the same. A thorough champion of encouraging women in technology, I was also 
                part of the WeTech Qualcomm Global Scholars Programme, and the Shenomics 'Lead Like a Girl' Fellowship.
